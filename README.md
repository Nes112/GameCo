# GameCo Video Game Sales Project

## Summary

Using the data on physical video game sales from https://www.vgchartz.com/, I sought to identify trends in the sales of different genres of video games across different regions from the early 1990s to 2016.

I did a descriptive analyis of the data, including a presentation and visualizations, aimed at business stakeholders.
